# World Happiness Data Analysis Project

## Achievement 6 Project: Advanced Analytics & Dashboard Design

### Objective
The objective of this project is to conduct an advanced exploratory analysis of world happiness data using Python. The analysis will involve visualizations, geospatial analysis, regression analysis, cluster analysis, and time-series analysis. The final results will be presented through an interactive Tableau dashboard, showcasing key insights derived from the exploration.

### Data Selection
The chosen data set for this project is [World Happiness Report on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness). It meets the criteria outlined in the project brief, including being open source, from an authoritative source, containing non-anonymized column names, and having a geographical component.

### Analysis Criteria
Throughout the achievement, the following analyses will be conducted, some of which are contributing to the final dashboard:

- Exploratory analysis through visualizations (scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots, and categorical plots).
- Geospatial analysis using a shapefile.
- Regression analysis.
- Cluster analysis.
- Time-series analysis.

### Dashboard Requirements
The Tableau dashboard will serve as a visual representation of the analytical journey, curating key results. It will include:

- Introduction page describing the project.
- Results of initial exploratory analysis.
- Explanation of how results led to defining research questions/hypotheses.
- Geospatial component.
- Addressing defined questions/hypotheses using advanced analytical techniques.
- Results summary page explaining the impact on initial research questions/hypotheses.
- Details on limitations of the project.
- Proposal of next steps for further analysis.

### Project Progression
The project will progress through exercises, each contributing to the final dashboard. Key deliverables include:

- **Exercise 6.1:** Sourcing Open Data
- **Exercise 6.2:** Exploring Relationships
- **Exercise 6.3:** Geographical Visualizations with Python
- **Exercise 6.4:** Supervised Machine Learning: Regression
- **Exercise 6.5:** Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering
- **Exercise 6.6:** Sourcing & Analyzing Time Series Data
- **Exercise 6.7:** Creating Data Dashboards
